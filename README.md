Word2Vec Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains Python code for implementing the Word2Vec model from scratch. Word2Vec is a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used to learn distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space. This implementation allows you to understand the inner workings of Word2Vec, including both the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram architectures.

Explore Word Embeddings:
Use the provided example scripts or modify word2vec.py to suit your specific needs. Visualize embeddings to understand relationships between words in the vector space.

Contributing:
Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you find issues or want to improve the implementation, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.

Acknowledgments:
This implementation is inspired by the original Word2Vec paper and various resources in NLP and machine learning.
